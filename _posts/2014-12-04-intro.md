  Last year at The Greater Chicago Food Depository, they distributed enough food to be equivalent to 154,000 meals a day. For this reason I chose to do my volunteer work at The Greater Chicago Food Depository. Their number one goal is to end hunger and not just by handing out bags of chips and cans of soda. They distribute fresh produce and other fresh items as much as possible to ensure that these food insecure people have some nutritious intake.
