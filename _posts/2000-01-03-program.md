13:30-13:35 - Opening session (Marco Netto, IBM Research)<br>
<br>

13:35-14:30 - Keynote: Valerie Issarny (INRIA Paris) <br>

<p><small> Biography: <em>She holds a “Director of research” position at Inria, the French National
Institute for computer science and applied mathematics. Her research lies in the
study of middleware solutions easing the development of distributed
collaborative services, including mobile services deployed over smartphones and
interacting with sensors and actuators. From 2002 to 2013, she led the ARLES
research team in which her team investigated distributed software systems leveraging
wirelessly networked devices, with a special emphasis on service-oriented
systems. In 2013, she received one of the “12 Etoiles de l’Europe”, awarded by the
French Ministry of Research in recognition of the coordination of the FP7 ICT
FET IP CONNECT project on emergent middleware (2009-13). In 2014, she was made
a Knight of France's Legion d’honneur for my contribution to Higher Education
and Research. Since summer 2013, Valerie is the scientific coordinator of the
Inria@SiliconValley program (https://project.inria.fr/siliconvalley/) promoting
and fostering collaboration between Inria and California universities. She also
coordinates the CityLab@Inria research program (http://citylab.inria.fr/)
dedicated to the study of urban software systems promoting citizen engagement.
She regularly serves in the program committees of major conferences of the software
engineering and middleware domains. Valerie is currently associate editor of IEEE
Transactions on Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Service Computing,
and ACM Transactions on the Internet of Things. </em></small></p>
