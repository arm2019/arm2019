### Submission


We will aim to create better outreach for the papers in ARM by selecting the best papers from the workshop and inviting the authors of those papers to submit an extended and expanded manuscript (40% new material will be required for the extended manuscript) towards a special issue of <a href="https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/">Journal of Internet Services and Applications</a>.


Please submit papers to https://middleware19.hotcrp.com.

Submissions must be in English, limited to 8 pages in the IEEE conference format (see <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" style="color:white">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a> )

All submissions should be made electronically through: <a href="https://middleware19.hotcrp.com"> https://middleware19.hotcrp.com </a>

Attendees must register in the IACM/IFIP/Usenix Middleware 2019 to take part in ARM2019.
