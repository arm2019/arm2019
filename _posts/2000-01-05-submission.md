### Submission


All submissions should be made electronically through: <a href="https://middleware19.hotcrp.com"> https://middleware19.hotcrp.com </a>

Authors should use the "ACM Standard" format for conference proceedings, with a limit of 6 pages.

Attendees must register in the IACM/IFIP/Usenix Middleware 2019 to take part in ARM2019.

We will aim to create better outreach for the papers in ARM by selecting the best papers from the workshop and inviting the authors of those papers to submit an extended and expanded manuscript (40% new material will be required for the extended manuscript) towards a publication in the <a href="https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/"> SpringerNature Journal of Internet Services and Applications</a> (pending).
